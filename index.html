        <h2>ðŸ”¥ Altadena Fire Relief Fund</h2>
        <p>Altadena, California â€” a historically Black and under-supported community â€” is suffering from the devastating effects of recent wildfires. Mainstream aid isnâ€™t reaching them fast enough, and we believe crypto can help fill that gap.</p>
        <p><strong>EQNOIR has committed 100 billion tokens</strong> to create a dedicated relief fund focused solely on Altadena families in need.</p>
        <p>Weâ€™re calling on partners, community leaders, and organizers to collaborate and help us deploy real-time support through blockchain-based aid.</p>
